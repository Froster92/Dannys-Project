<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Danny Foster. I am 32 years old and I have lived in Georgia my entire life! 
  I am a veteran and I have an extensive background in law enforcement. 
  While I do enjoy helping others and making the community a safer place, 
  I have decided to develop myself and learn a new skill, WEB DEVELOPMENT!</p>
  <br/>
  <p>I have dedicated myself and strive to be hardworking and an honest team player. 
    I never shy away from a challenge, love to learn something new, 
    and always do everything in my power to accomplish any mission placed in front of me.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>Communication has always been a strong suit for me. I am quick to mold into any team I have ever been placed in
    and get along with anyone. I am fun-loving but hard-working at the same time. 
    My previous experience in Law Enforcement has taught me how to thrive in high-stress situation 
    and still get the job done in a professional, top-notch manner. Please reach out to me for any questions, concerns, or interest.
