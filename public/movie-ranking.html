<h2>These are my top 3 movies:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Christmas Story (1983)</h3>
<p>Who doesn't enjoy a wholesome Christmas movie? This movie was one of my favorites growing up and has become a tradition to watch in my household.</p>
<h3>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)</h3>
<p>Hilarious movie that will have you rolling around on the floor. Will Ferrel is a masterclass comedian in this comedy.</p>
<h3>Batman: The Dark Night (2008)</h3>
<p>This action thriller will have you on the edge of your seat. Heath Ledger as "The Joker" was one of the best preformances of an actor of all time. </p>
